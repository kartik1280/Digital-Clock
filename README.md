# Digital Clock

A simple digital clock application built with Python and PyQt5. The clock displays the current time in hours, minutes, and seconds with a sleek digital-style interface that updates every second.

## Features

- Real-time clock display updated every second
- Bold and clear digital font for easy readability
- Customizable font color and background
- Simple and lightweight PyQt5 GUI application

## Installation

Make sure you have Python installed (version 3.x recommended).
Install the required Python packages using pip:
pip install PyQt5
pip install PyQt5-tools # Optional, for GUI tools and designer

Download or clone this repository:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/digital-clock.git

Place a digital font `.ttf` file (e.g., `digital-7.ttf`) in the same directory as the script, or update the font path in the code.

## Usage

Run the application by executing the script:
python digital_clock.py

A window will open showing the current time in digital font. The time updates every second automatically.

## Customization

- To change the font style, replace the `.ttf` font file and update the filename in the code.
- Modify the font size, color, and background color in the `initUI()` method to suit your preferences.
